# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detections
This repository contains a project on credit card fraud detection using machine learning algorithms. The primary objective is to classify transactions as either valid or fraudulent based on a given dataset.

# Overview
Credit card fraud is a significant issue, costing billions annually. This project aims to address this problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to accurately identify fraudulent transactions. The model used in this project is the Random Forest algorithm, known for its robustness and accuracy in classification tasks.

# How It Works
Data Preprocessing: The dataset undergoes cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.
Feature Selection: Important features are selected to improve model performance and reduce complexity.
Model Training: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the preprocessed dataset to learn the patterns associated with valid and fraudulent transactions.
Evaluation: The model is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its effectiveness in detecting fraud.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023?resource=download) . It contains anonymized credit card transactions, with features that have been transformed using PCA.

# Results
The Random Forest model achieves high accuracy and performs well in distinguishing between valid and fraudulent transactions.
